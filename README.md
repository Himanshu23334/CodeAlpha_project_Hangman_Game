# CodeAlpha_project_Hangman_Game
This is a simple console-based Hangman game in Python where the player guesses a randomly chosen word from a list of five. The player inputs one letter at a time, with up to six incorrect guesses allowed. The game displays progress, tracks guessed letters, and ends with a win or loss message based on the outcome.
